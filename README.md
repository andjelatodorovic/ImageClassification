# ImageClassification

Classifing images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. 
The images need to be normalized and the labels need to be one-hot encoded, them inserted into the convolutional network with convolutional, max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers. Quite poor on the performance 50-70%
